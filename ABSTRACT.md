The **CVC-ClinicDB** dataset includes 612 frames taken from colonoscopy videos, which feature numerous instances of *polyp*. Accompanying these frames, the ground truth for the polyps is also provided. The ground truth is represented by a mask that corresponds to the area of the image occupied by the polyp.

CVC-ClinicDB has been generated from 25 different video studies. For each study at least a sequence containing a polyp was extracted. Considering this, CVC-ClinicDB database is composed by frames from 29 different sequences containing a polyp.

Finally, a set of frames were selected from each sequence, paying particular attention in showing several points of view of the polyp.

The correspondence between the number of frame and the video sequence is as follows:
